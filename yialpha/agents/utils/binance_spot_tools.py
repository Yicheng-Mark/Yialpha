"""LangChain ``@tool`` wrappers for the Binance SPOT data vendors.

Each tool is a thin pass-through to ``route_to_vendor`` — same shape as
:mod:`yialpha.agents.utils.binance_perp_tools` — so the optional-category
fallback (429/network -> sentinel) is reused verbatim. Only the market analyst
advertises these (and only for ``asset_type == "crypto_spot"``); the market
``ToolNode`` carries them too so the dispatched tool_calls resolve, but for
non-spot runs the LLM never names them so they stay dormant.

Spot carries OHLCV + 24h ticker only (no funding/OI/leverage — those are
perp-only). The spot-perp basis tool is the cross-venue signal spot unlocks:
it exposes the perpetual's premium/discount vs this spot reference.
