"""LangChain ``@tool`` wrapper over the deterministic valuation engine.

The fundamentals analyst already pulls line items via ``get_fundamentals`` /
``get_balance_sheet`` / ``get_income_statement``. This tool is a Program-of-
Thought (REFERENCES.md #19) sink for those figures: the analyst passes the
numbers it has gathered and Python computes every intrinsic-value metric they
support -- Graham number, NCAV, PEG, owner earnings, two-stage DCF, WACC, and
the margin of safety versus the market price -- and returns them as a
deterministic markdown table. Delegating the arithmetic to Python removes the
class of LLM confabulation where a "margin of safety" is cited that the
reported figures do not support.

The tool is gated onto the fundamentals analyst by ``YIALPHA_VALUATION_TOOLS``
(off by default = the analyst's tool list, and therefore its prompt, is
byte-for-byte unchanged when the flag is unset).
