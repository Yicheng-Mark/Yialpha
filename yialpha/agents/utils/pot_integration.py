"""Program-of-Thoughts integration: LLM emits code, the sandbox runs the numbers.

The PoT executor (:mod:`yialpha.agents.utils.pot_executor`) runs Python in
a restricted sandbox. This module is the glue that asks an LLM to *produce* that
code for a numerical question, runs it, and -- on failure -- feeds the error
back for one repair pass. The roadmap's goal ("analysts' support/resistance,
percentage moves, valuation ratios must go through PoT, not mental arithmetic")
is realized by routing numeric claims through :class:`PotAnalyzer`.

Keeps the analyst LLMs in charge of *which* numbers matter; this layer only
guarantees the arithmetic is correct by externalizing it to Python.
