"""Process-global Binance IP-weight rate limiter (header-driven backoff).

Binance throttles by *request weight*, not request count, and the budget is
per-IP per-product-line in a rolling 1-minute window. The server reports the
current cumulative consumption in the ``X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-1M`` response header
on every reply, so the client can track the budget *as the server sees it* and
back off before tripping a 429 — instead of only reacting to one. This module
owns that tracking; :mod:`yialpha.dataflows.binance` consults it.

One limiter per product line (``"fapi"`` for USDT-M perpetuals at the
documented 2400/min budget, ``"spot"`` for /api/v3 at 6000/min — Binance
counts spot and futures weight independently against the same IP). The
limiter is shared across every
worker graph in the process, so K batch workers drawing on one IP count against
ONE budget rather than K. It is thread-safe (``batch_concurrency=true`` runs K
market analysts in a thread pool) but NOT cross-process — ``run_robust``'s
per-ticker subprocesses share an IP but no budget today, and the reactive
429/418 path in ``binance._http_get`` remains the floor either way.

The limiter only changes *when* a request is issued, never what data comes back,
so a per-ticker analysis stays byte-equivalent to an unthrottled run (possibly
slower). It is consulted only when ``binance_proactive_backoff`` is on (off by
default = byte-equivalent to today).
