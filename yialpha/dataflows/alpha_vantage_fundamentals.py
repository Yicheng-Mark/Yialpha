    A report whose fiscal period ends on/before ``curr_date`` is not necessarily
    public then -- it is filed days to weeks later (see
    :func:`yialpha.dataflows.utils.is_filing_public`). Keeping only reports
    whose period end + filing lag is on/before ``curr_date`` prevents a backtest
    from reading a report the market could not yet have seen.

    ``_make_api_request`` always returns the raw response *text* (``str``),
    so a JSON statement payload arrives here as a string. It is parsed with
    ``json.loads`` and the filtered ``dict`` is returned; a string that is not
    valid JSON (a CSV dataset, or an error/notice body) is returned unchanged —
    there is nothing statement-shaped to filter in it. The returned dict is
    consumed downstream exactly like a dict response (the tool layer
    JSON-serializes non-str tool outputs).
