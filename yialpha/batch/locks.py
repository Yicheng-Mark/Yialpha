"""File locks for shared resources under multi-ticker concurrency.

The batch runner fans tickers out across worker threads in ONE process, so the
contention that matters is between those threads. A process-local
``threading.Lock`` (keyed by path) fully serializes them. When the optional
``filelock`` package is installed we ALSO take an OS-level lock, so two
separate processes (e.g. a batch run plus a live analysis in another terminal)
coordinate on the same backing file. OS file locks are per-process, not
per-thread, so the threading lock is always taken first to serialize threads
within this process regardless of whether ``filelock`` is available.

This module has NO dependency on the rest of ``yialpha.batch`` (or anything in
``yialpha``) so that core modules — the memory log and the OHLCV cache — can
import it at module top level without an import cycle. ``yialpha/batch/__init__``
must stay empty for the same reason.
