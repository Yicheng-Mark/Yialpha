"""Process-global shared httpx client for LLM calls (P1a).

When ``YIALPHA_HTTP_KEEPALIVE=true``, every LLM client in the process shares
ONE ``httpx.Client`` so the connection to the provider (and the SOCKS5 proxy) is
kept alive and reused across all K worker graphs, instead of each call opening a
fresh TLS+proxy handshake. This is the transport change that lets ``--workers``
scale past ~3 without saturating the proxy's connection table.

Transport-only: it changes nothing about what is sent to the model — no prompt,
reasoning, or temperature effect. Off by default; the provider SDK's own
per-client httpx pool is used otherwise (today's behaviour).

``httpx.Client`` (sync) is thread-safe, so the worker graphs may share one
instance. It reads proxy settings from the environment (``trust_env=True``), so
the SOCKS5 proxy in ``.env`` is honored exactly as the provider SDK already does
it — no new proxy configuration here.
