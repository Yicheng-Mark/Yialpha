"""Symbol normalization and market-data error types for vendor calls.

Yahoo Finance (the default vendor) uses specific ticker conventions that
differ from the broker / TradingView / MT5 style symbols users often type:

    user types        Yahoo wants       why
    ---------------   ---------------   -----------------------------------
    XAUUSD, XAUUSD+   GC=F              gold has no forex pair on Yahoo;
                                        it is quoted as a COMEX future
    EURUSD            EURUSD=X          spot forex pairs take a ``=X`` suffix
    BTCUSD            BTC-USD           crypto pairs use a ``-`` separator
    SPX500, US500     ^GSPC             index CFDs map to Yahoo index symbols

Passing the raw broker symbol to Yahoo returns an empty result, which the
agents previously received as free text and could hallucinate a price
around (see issue #781). Centralizing the mapping here means every yfinance
entry point resolves symbols the same way, and new instruments are added by
appending a table row rather than editing call sites.
