"""Process-global shared requests.Session for Binance market-data calls.

When ``YIAGENTS_BINANCE_HTTP_KEEPALIVE=true``, every Binance GET in the process
shares ONE ``requests.Session`` so the TLS / SOCKS5-proxy connection is kept
alive and reused across calls (and across K worker graphs sharing one IP),
instead of each call opening a fresh ``requests.get`` with a full TLS+proxy
handshake. Mirrors :mod:`yiagents.llm_clients.http_client` (the LLM-side
shared ``httpx.Client``) for the data-vendor side.

Transport-only: it changes nothing about what is sent to Binance — same URL,
params, headers, proxies, timeout → the same response bytes. Off by default;
the per-call ``requests.get`` (today's behaviour) is used otherwise.

Thread-safety: a ``requests.Session`` is safe for concurrent read-only GETs in
our usage — the underlying urllib3 ``PoolManager`` is thread-safe, and the
public market-data endpoints carry no auth/cookies so there is no session-level
state to race on. This matches the already-trusted LLM keepalive pattern.
``requests.Session`` defaults to ``trust_env=True``, so it reads
``HTTP_PROXY``/``HTTPS_PROXY``/``NO_PROXY`` from the environment exactly as
:func:`yiagents.dataflows.utils.proxy_map` already does — the SOCKS5 proxy in
``.env`` is honoured with no new proxy configuration here.
