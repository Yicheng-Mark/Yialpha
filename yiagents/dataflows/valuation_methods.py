"""Deterministic intrinsic-value math (pure functions, no I/O, no LLM).

The fundamentals analyst is an LLM, and LLMs confabulate arithmetic -- citing a
"Graham number" or a "margin of safety" that does not follow from the reported
figures. This module is the deterministic counterpart: the canonical intrinsic-
value formulas of public, textbook finance (Graham's *Intelligent Investor*,
Lynch's *One Up on Wall Street*, Buffett's 1986 owner-earnings letter,
Damodaran's DCF/WACC), each as a pure function of explicit numeric inputs.

Everything is in ``float | None``: a guard that cannot be satisfied (negative
book value, ``r <= g`` in a terminal model, non-positive price) returns ``None``
rather than a misleading number, so callers surface "n/a" instead of a
fabricated value. No vendor code, no network, no caching -- the math only.

These are intentionally NOT named after any investor (the persona-prompting
literature, REFERENCES.md #18, shows named-persona framing hurts reasoning);
the formulas are credited to their sources in the docstrings and in
REFERENCES.md, never in the call surface.
