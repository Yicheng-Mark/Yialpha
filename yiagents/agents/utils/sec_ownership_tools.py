"""LangChain ``@tool`` wrappers for the SEC ownership/short-interest vendors.

Three thin pass-throughs to ``route_to_vendor`` — same shape as the Binance tool
modules — so the optional-category fallback (429/network/non-US -> sentinel) is
reused verbatim. Only the fundamentals analyst advertises these, and only when
``YIAGENTS_SEC_OWNERSHIP`` is on; the fundamentals ``ToolNode`` carries them too
so dispatched tool_calls resolve, but for a default run the LLM never names them
so they stay dormant.

* ``get_form4_insider_trading`` — insider buys/sells (Form 4). US-only (needs a
  CIK); a non-US ticker degrades to the ``NO_DATA_AVAILABLE`` sentinel.
* ``get_ftd_data`` — fails-to-deliver balances (CNS). Ticker-keyed; a non-US
  ticker yields an honest "no fails reported" string rather than an error.
* ``get_institutional_holdings`` — top institutional 13F holders, reverse-
  aggregated from the SEC bulk Form 13F Data Sets by CUSIP (Track B2.1).
  US-only (needs a CIK + a companyfacts EntityCusip); a non-US ticker or
  missing CUSIP degrades to the ``NO_DATA_AVAILABLE`` sentinel.

All three are point-in-time correct (Form 4 by ``filingDate``; FTD by
cutoff + publication lag; 13F by dataset period-end + publication lag) so
they are safe to use in backtests.
