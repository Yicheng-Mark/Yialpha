"""Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) sandbox executor for analyst numerical reasoning.

Analyst LLMs currently do arithmetic in their heads and get roughly half of the
calculations wrong. The PoT pattern externalizes the math: the LLM emits Python
code that performs the computation, this module runs that code in a restricted
namespace seeded with the *verified* market data, and the computed numbers are
returned to the caller. Externalizing the arithmetic raises numerical accuracy
considerably.

SECURITY MODEL — read this before relying on this module:

    The sandbox reduces risk for *trusted*, LLM-generated analysis code. It is
    NOT a hard security boundary against adversarial input. Defense is layered:

    1. ``__builtins__`` is replaced with a fixed allowlist, removing
       ``__import__``, ``open``, ``eval``, ``exec``, ``compile``, ``getattr``,
       ``globals``, ``locals``, ``input``, ``breakpoint``, etc. Without
       ``__import__`` the literal ``import os`` statement cannot succeed even
       if it slips past the token guard.
    2. Only ``numpy`` (as ``np``) and ``pandas`` (as ``pd``) are exposed. No
       ``os``/``sys``/``subprocess``.
    3. A pre-exec token scan rejects obviously dangerous substrings
       (``__import__``, ``import os``, ``subprocess``, ``open(``, ...) before
       any code runs. This is defense-in-depth; the restricted builtins are the
       real barrier.
    4. Code size (line count) is capped to bound runtime.
    5. A best-effort timeout is applied. On POSIX this uses ``SIGALRM``; on
       Windows (where ``setitimer`` is unavailable) it falls back to a
       thread-based watchdog that sets a flag. The timeout is best-effort and
       must never crash the host process.

If you need to run genuinely untrusted code, do not use this module — reach for
a container/seccomp-based sandbox instead.

CONVENTION: the LLM MUST assign its final answer to a variable named ``result``
(or to the name passed as ``result_var``). ``exec`` cannot reliably surface the
value of a bare trailing expression, so the result is read back from the
namespace by name.

    Why this exists: numpy and pandas perform *lazy* submodule imports at

    on first call). If ``__import__`` is absent from ``__builtins__`` those
    internal calls raise ``KeyError: '__import__'`` and crash otherwise-valid
    analysis code.

    The guard restores the name but tightens its behavior to a strict
    allowlist: only modules that are *already present in ``sys.modules``*
    (i.e. were imported by the host before the sandbox ran, never by the
    sandboxed code itself) and whose top-level package is numpy or pandas
