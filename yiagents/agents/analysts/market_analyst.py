INDICATOR_CATALOG = """Moving Averages:
- close_50_sma: 50 SMA: A medium-term trend indicator. Usage: Identify trend direction and serve as dynamic support/resistance. Tips: It lags price; combine with faster indicators for timely signals.
- close_200_sma: 200 SMA: A long-term trend benchmark. Usage: Confirm overall market trend and identify golden/death cross setups. Tips: It reacts slowly; best for strategic trend confirmation rather than frequent trading entries.
- close_10_ema: 10 EMA: A responsive short-term average. Usage: Capture quick shifts in momentum and potential entry points. Tips: Prone to noise in choppy markets; use alongside longer averages for filtering false signals.

MACD Related:
- macd: MACD: Computes momentum via differences of EMAs. Usage: Look for crossovers and divergence as signals of trend changes. Tips: Confirm with other indicators in low-volatility or sideways markets.
- macds: MACD Signal: An EMA smoothing of the MACD line. Usage: Use crossovers with the MACD line to trigger trades. Tips: Should be part of a broader strategy to avoid false positives.
- macdh: MACD Histogram: Shows the gap between the MACD line and its signal. Usage: Visualize momentum strength and spot divergence early. Tips: Can be volatile; complement with additional filters in fast-moving markets.

Momentum Indicators:
- rsi: RSI: Measures momentum to flag overbought/oversold conditions. Usage: Apply 70/30 thresholds and watch for divergence to signal reversals. Tips: In strong trends, RSI may remain extreme; always cross-check with trend analysis.

Volatility Indicators:
- boll: Bollinger Middle: A 20 SMA serving as the basis for Bollinger Bands. Usage: Acts as a dynamic benchmark for price movement. Tips: Combine with the upper and lower bands to effectively spot breakouts or reversals.
- boll_ub: Bollinger Upper Band: Typically 2 standard deviations above the middle line. Usage: Signals potential overbought conditions and breakout zones. Tips: Confirm signals with other tools; prices may ride the band in strong trends.
- boll_lb: Bollinger Lower Band: Typically 2 standard deviations below the middle line. Usage: Indicates potential oversold conditions. Tips: Use additional analysis to avoid false reversal signals.
- atr: ATR: Averages true range to measure volatility. Usage: Set stop-loss levels and adjust position sizes based on current market volatility. Tips: It's a reactive measure, so use it as part of a broader risk management strategy.

Volume-Based Indicators:
- vwma: VWMA: A moving average weighted by volume. Usage: Confirm trends by integrating price action with volume data. Tips: Watch for skewed results from volume spikes; use in combination with other volume analyses."""
