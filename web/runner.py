"""Spawn ``scripts/run_robust.py`` as a subprocess and watch its progress.

We never call ``propagate()`` in-process: a DeepSeek mid-response hang freezes
the interpreter (``ssl.read`` cannot be interrupted) and there is no in-process
recovery. ``run_robust`` runs each ticker in its own OS process behind a
wall-clock watchdog with ``taskkill /F /T`` so a hang is killed and retried.

We deliberately do NOT add an outer timeout or force-kill here — ``run_robust``
owns that contract, and a second outer watchdog would race it (double-kill,
spurious retries). The watcher only reads stdout for the coarse-grained
``attempt N/M`` banner and records the final exit code.

Success criterion is ``proc.returncode == 0``. ``run_robust`` internally
treats a run as successful only when a fresh ``complete_report.md`` appeared
(rc 0 with no new report → retry), so rc 0 is a reliable completion signal.
